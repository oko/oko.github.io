Or rather, a single introduction. I'm Jacob Okamoto: programmer, sysadmin, cyclist, and recent graduate of the University of Minnesota&mdash;Twin Cities. This blog is for more academic and philosophical musings; if you're looking for competitive cycling and other bike-related rambling, [Tracki.es](http://tracki.es) is where you should be going (eventually).
